# Dashboard (React) - Scaffold
This is a minimal React scaffold for a dashboard that can call the FastAPI endpoints for forecasts and KPIs.
It's intentionally minimal â€” use `create-react-app` or your preferred tooling to expand components.

Steps to run locally (if node/npm installed):
1. cd dashboard
2. npx create-react-app .
3. Replace src/App.js with a simple fetch to the API endpoints per your UI design.
4. npm start
